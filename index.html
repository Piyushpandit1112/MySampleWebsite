                Transforming Interior Designing here

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                By the turn of the 20th century, amateur advisors and publications were increasingly challenging the
                monopoly that the large retail companies had on interior design. English feminist author Mary Haweis
                wrote a series of widely read essays in the 1880s in which she derided the eagerness with which aspiring
                middle-class people furnished their houses according to the rigid models offered to them by the
                retailers. She advocated the individual adoption of a particular style, tailor-made to the
                individual needs and preferences of the customer: To
                meet the growing demand for contract interior work on projects such as offices, hotels, and public
                buildings, these businesses became much larger and more complex, employing builders, joiners,
                plasterers,

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                In the mid-to-late 19th century, interior design services expanded greatly, as the middle class in
                industrial countries grew in size and prosperity and began to desire the domestic trappings of wealth to
                cement their new status. Large furniture firms began to branch out into general interior design and
                management, offering full house furnishings in a variety of styles. This business model flourished from
                the mid-century to 1914, when this role was increasingly usurped by independent, often amateur,
                designers. </p>
                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                This paved the way for the emergence of the professional interior design in the mid-20th
                century.In the 1950s and 1960s, upholsterers began to expand their business remits. They framed their
                business more broadly and in artistic terms and began to advertise their furnishings to the public.
